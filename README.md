### Uses standard single pixel Neopixel STLs for ERCF
### Uses STL in Github for rear of ERCT

This Flexible PCB LED is for ERCFv2.  It reduces the amount of soldering you are required to do for the NeoPixel arrays found in the front of the ERCFv2 and the rear of the Enraged Rabbit Cotton Tail (ERCT)

PCBs are groups of 4 lights and can be cut with scissors along the dotted line to remove up to 3 lights if your ERCFv2 system is not a multiple of 4 filament blocks.

Input is on left side of PCB; Output is on right side of PCB.

### Compatibility:

-ERCFv2 - Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder v2

-ERCT - Enraged Rabbit Cotton Tail (Filament Buffer) [STL for rear of ERCT included in GitHub Repository]
